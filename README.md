# rusty-rifle


Demo for a 3ps game. 

**WASD** to move around, **Mouse** to look, **Right Click** to aim and **Left Click** to shoot.
**Left Shift** to run and **Space** to jump.


Includes inventory system with 2 weapons, each with its own bullet type, as well as pickable bullet items that recharge both ammo types. 
**F** for weapon switch.

Wins/Losses are saved locally.

Basic behaviour for agents which simply walk towards the player and shoot at it.

Kill all enemy agents to win, otherwise it's a loss if you get killed first.
